<strong>Subject:</strong> Request to Add Instructors to Private GitHub Repo
<strong>Message:</strong><br>
<em>"Dear [Instructors’ Names],</em>
<em>I’ve set up the environment and dependencies for the project and was wondering if it would be appropriate to add you to my private GitHub repository. I’d appreciate any guidance on improving performance, scalability, and design principles. Please let me know if this is feasible or if there’s a more suitable way to seek feedback. Apologies if this request is out of scope.</em>
<em>Thank you for your time!</em>
<em>Best,</em><br>
