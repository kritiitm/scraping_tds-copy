  Respected Sir <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>,
I realized there are still many topics to learn in order to complete the TDS Course ( With an A or S Grade) as I have missed some questions (Couldn’t do even after studying the videos ) .
Therefore wanted to learn and regardless of the scoring I still wish to complete GA1 but, I see that I can’t access the questions  anymore …
Is there any way to give the answers in the portal and check. I just want to learn and test my knowledge
Thank You,<br>
