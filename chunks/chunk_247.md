  because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.
Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.
The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.
Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”
Kind regards
