  <a class="mention" href="/u/23f300327">@23F300327</a> You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.
GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.
Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.
Also the live sessions on <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&amp;si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">youtube</a> will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.
There will be session <span class="discourse-local-date" data-date="2025-01-20" data-email-preview="2025-01-20T14:30:00Z UTC" data-range="from" data-time="20:00:00" data-timezone="Asia/Calcutta">2025-01-20T14:30:00Z</span>â†’<span class="discourse-local-date" data-date="2025-01-20" data-email-preview="2025-01-20T16:30:00Z UTC" data-range="to" data-time="22:00:00" data-timezone="Asia/Calcutta">2025-01-20T16:30:00Z</span> which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.
The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is <a href="http://meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy</a>
