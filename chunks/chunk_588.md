  <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> sir, I see that the project 1 timeline was changed from February 7 - 17, 2025 to January 17 - February 15 which undoubtedly is a good increase in duration. However, I have my GATE DA exam on Feb 15 and the exam center is unexpectedly far. So, I request you to consider pushing the deadline to at least Feb 16. If not, Iâ€™ll still do my best.
