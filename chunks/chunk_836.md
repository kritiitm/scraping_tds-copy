  Please read the deliverables and evalute section.
datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.
Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.
Kind regards
