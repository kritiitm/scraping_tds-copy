I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.
<ul>
<li><strong>Bonus: Additional tasks</strong>. We <em>may</em> pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.<br>
Regards,</li>
</ul>
