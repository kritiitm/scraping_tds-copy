  Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/jayeshbansal">@Jayeshbansal</a>
Until not clicked on save button answers getâ€™s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.
I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.
Kind regards
