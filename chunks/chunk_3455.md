  Dear Sir,<br>
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.
Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.
With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.
