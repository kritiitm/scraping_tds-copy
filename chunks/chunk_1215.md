  Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Isolation</strong> – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reproducibility</strong> – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Portability</strong> – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)</strong></li>
</ol>
• Good for quick experimentation and testing.
• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Using requirements.txt</strong></li>
</ol>
• Best for <strong>reproducibility</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong> since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.
<strong>Specifying Versions in requirements.txt</strong>
• If you <strong>don’t specify a version</strong>, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.
• If you <strong>do specify a version (package==1.2.3)</strong>, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.
<strong>Handling Version Conflicts</strong>
• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.
• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:
• Using <strong>greater than/less than constraints</strong>: package&gt;=1.2,&lt;2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).
• Running pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.
<strong>Best Practices Summary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).</li>
<li>Use a <strong>requirements.txt</strong> file for reproducibility.</li>
<li>Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.</li>
<li>Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.</li>
</ul>
Kind regards
