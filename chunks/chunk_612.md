  We will be doing project session on <s>Tuesday 9 Feb</s> [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/23f1002382">@23f1002382</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2000237">@23f2000237</a>) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 &amp; 3.
We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 &amp; 3.
The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.
Kind regards
