We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -
<ul>
<li>
Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course <strong>not as a full-time</strong> student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.
</li>
<li>
Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.
</li>
<li>
Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.
</li>
</ul>
Thank you.
