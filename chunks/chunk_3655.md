When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?

Sir, this sounds reasonably fair. But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this.
I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA&amp; as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks
