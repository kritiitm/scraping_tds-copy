  Dear <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/anand">@Anand</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/bharathi">@Bharathi</a>
First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the <strong>TDS team</strong> in supporting us throughout this course. The <strong>live sessions and guidance</strong> have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.
However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.

<h3><a name="p-599766-lack-of-prerequisites-2" class="anchor" href="#p-599766-lack-of-prerequisites-2"></a><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <strong>Lack of Prerequisites</strong></h3>
This course did not list any <strong>prerequisites</strong>, leading many students—including those from <strong>non-technical backgrounds</strong>—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the <strong>course content, assignments, and projects</strong> have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.

The <strong>difficulty of the projects</strong> has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to <strong>rely heavily on peer support</strong> just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.

Many students joined <strong>TDS</strong> based on past <strong>Discourse posts and feedback</strong>, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for <strong>working professionals</strong> and students without prior experience.

While we have put in significant effort—spending <strong>2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)</strong> to secure good scores—we still find ourselves <strong>struggling to meet expectations</strong> for the <strong>projects and RoE</strong>, which are significantly harder than anticipated.
We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.
We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.
Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.
