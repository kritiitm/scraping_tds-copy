  Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.
Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.
Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.
Warm Regards,<br>
