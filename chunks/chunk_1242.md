  Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.
Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?
