  Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created soon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover these.
<ol>
<li>Syllabus</li>
<li>kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice</li>
<li>I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time</li>
<li>Any mock or resource to practice from?</li>
<li>additional tips, if any</li>
</ol>
