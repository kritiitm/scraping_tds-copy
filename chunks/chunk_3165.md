  Sir, my evaluation log file is missing, even though I followed all the steps to generate the Docker image correctly. The system indicates that the server didn’t start within 5 minutes, but when I uploaded it, everything was working fine. I put in a lot of effort into this project, and I’m worried I might receive a zero despite making the submission correctly. Kindly help me resolve this issue. My roll number is 22F3004068.
Additionally, my Docker image ID was <strong>d2f27c03b878</strong>, but the ID mentioned in the email was <strong>dfac8596cd4c</strong>. Please provide clarity on this discrepancy.
I have also attached my Docker <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exrdQOCjbrCFux2hC4OQH_BfgiijCzD1/view?usp=drivesdk" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">log file</a> for reference<br>
