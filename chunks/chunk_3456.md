I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.
We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.
<strong>A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.</strong>
<strong>Critical failures prevents everything else from working</strong> and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.
I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.
Kindest regards
