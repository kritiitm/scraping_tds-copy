  Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.
Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.
