  You won’t be required to update someone else’s repo.<br>
Any github name, repo name is fine.<br>
Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.

If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.<br>
Can you please at least hint at a solution?

In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that.
