  Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/22f2000559">@22f2000559</a>
I can confirm that our server did record your marks as 7, we will make a correction in the dashboard. Thanks for letting us know. My sincere apologies for the error.
If the marks on the dashboard are not changed within the next 7 days, please let us know. I will follow it up on my end and try to get the correction pushed as soon as possible.
Kind regards
