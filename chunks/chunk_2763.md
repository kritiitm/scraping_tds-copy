  We will be sending out emails to both sets. Ones who have to keep it on and ones who can shut it down. If you have not received a shutdown notice, assume that you have to keep it on. I apologise for the late reply, we ran into some unforeseen problems, hence the delay.
Thank you for your patience,<br>
Kind regards
