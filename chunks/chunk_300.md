Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.<br>
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.<br>
Do I need to do anything else ?<br>
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.<br>
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 â€¦it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks &amp; regards.
