As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.
