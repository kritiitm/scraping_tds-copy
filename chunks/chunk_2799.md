  I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms.
To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message.
Please look into this<br>
