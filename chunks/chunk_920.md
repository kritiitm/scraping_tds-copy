  Everytime I run datagen.py for the A1 task, the data file gets downloaded in the C drive instead of the current project folder. I even tried to set the current project folder as the root directory but it still downloads the files in C drive and I cant seem to find a workaround this. Can someone please help with this issue. Thanks!
