  <a class="mention" href="/u/21f1005510">@21F1005510</a> Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/">The Recruit</a> is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas">also known as Graymail in India</a>. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
<strong>Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?</strong> Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.
