  So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:
 → the set of question-answers pairs at first<br>
 → All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions<br>
 → Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.
Till now I have created the following:
 → Identification of the question, using embeddings<br>
 → extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question<br>
 → Implementation of 3 questions using this approach
If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.
*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">
