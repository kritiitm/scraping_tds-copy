  Hi, I have a few things to say
<h2><a name="p-614585-my-background-1" class="anchor" href="#p-614585-my-background-1"></a>My background :</h2>
I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.

In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):
<blockquote>
The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph</li>
<li>ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.</li>
<li>There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="p-614585-last-term-4" class="anchor" href="#p-614585-last-term-4"></a>Last Term</h3>
I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.
<h2><a name="p-614585-this-term-5" class="anchor" href="#p-614585-this-term-5"></a>This term.</h2>
I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.
In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.

This one line changed my view about ROE.

<strong>What does this RoE evaluate?</strong> Implicit learning.
</blockquote>
</aside>
I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.
I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.
Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.
In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing <code>SKLearn</code>. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.
This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an <em><strong>implicit</strong></em> way.
This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.
I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks
I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.
I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.
From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.
Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.

Just two suggestions
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.</li>
<li>While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.</li>
