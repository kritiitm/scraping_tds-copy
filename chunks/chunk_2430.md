  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> ( <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> ) <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like <strong>need</strong>
<strong>Summary: Please extend Project 2 deadline by 2 days(April 1st),</strong><br>
<em>(actually 1 day extension is April 1st)</em>
