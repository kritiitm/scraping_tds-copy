  Thanks for your reply <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a><br>
I’ve figured out the solution to that particular question.<br>
The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions—similar to the project 1 workflow—and This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva’s and oppe’s )<br>
Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.
