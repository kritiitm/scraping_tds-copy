  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again .
