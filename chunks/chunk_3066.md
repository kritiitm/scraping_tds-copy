  I have noticed that my image was run on a <code>x86_64</code> architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is <code>ARM</code>. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the <code>exec format error</code>.
This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
