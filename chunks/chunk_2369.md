  Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally,  to check for the accuracy of solving the question.
<ol>
<li>I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.</li>
<li>Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)<br>
Thanks!</li>
</ol>
Does anyone willing to work with me..?<br>
