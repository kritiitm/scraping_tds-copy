  Hi Saravanan,
I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name <code>Bob</code>, but it doesnâ€™t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.
We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.
kind regards
