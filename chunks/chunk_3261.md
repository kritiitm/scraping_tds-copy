<strong>Hello, sir</strong>   <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a>
I received the evaluation email for my <strong>Project 1 Docker Image</strong> submission, but unlike my friend (who got an email with his score), my email did <strong>not</strong> include my score.
My Docker image ID: <strong>6f446c9b84da</strong>
The email I received only contains logs and attachments, but no information about my actual score. in the mail recieved by my friend the score is clearly mentioned,
I would really appreciate it if you could <strong>clarify my project score</strong> and let me know if it was properly evaluated. If there is any issue, I request a reconsideration of my project evaluation.
Thank you for your help!
