  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge
If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this
Thanking you
waiting for your answer
