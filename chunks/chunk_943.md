Respected Sir,<br>
I sincerely request you to kindly consider granting a one-day extension for Project 1. Many key clarifications were provided in todayâ€™s session, and we need just one additional day to effectively implement them. This extension would be immensely helpful in ensuring a more refined submission.<br>
I truly appreciate your time and consideration.<br>
Thank you.
