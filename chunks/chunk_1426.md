  I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.
Please help with the second issue.
<ol>
<li>For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.<br>
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?</li>
</ol>
