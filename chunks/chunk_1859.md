  Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a>   and  <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> sir
It is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something decent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project.
Thanks<br>
Vikram
