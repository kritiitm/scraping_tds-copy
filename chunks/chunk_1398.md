  That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.
But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.
