  Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if <strong>name</strong> == ‘<strong>main</strong>’:
24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems.
