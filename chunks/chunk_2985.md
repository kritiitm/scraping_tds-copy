  We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.
Bottom line: wait till Tuesday<br>
Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.<br>
If not let us know
Kind regards.
