  Hi Instructor team,
Thank you for your response. Till week4, I have completed all my assignments using internet/gpt without fully understanding the concepts. I wondered how is it going to benefit me in the real world scenario. That said, now I am facing that situation in the name of Project1. No real learning till week4 but a project to  complete now. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/worried.png?v=12" title=":worried:" class="emoji" alt=":worried:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">
