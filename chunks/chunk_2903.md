Dear TDS Team,
There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:
<ol>
<li>Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.</li>
<li>In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.</li>
<li>The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.</li>
</ol>
The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.
Thank you for your support.
