  Hello Sir <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a><br>
What are implications on missing the project 1.<br>
Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.<br>
Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?
Thank you
PS: This isn’t any request to extend dates. I accept my fault and respect the dates provided by the team.
