  Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.<br>
The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.<br>
Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated.<br>
Thankyou<br>
