  Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> / <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a>
I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my todayâ€™s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.<br>
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.<br>
Could you please consider my request?<br>
Thank you.
