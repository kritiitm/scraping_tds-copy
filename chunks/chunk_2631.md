  Dear Shahzada,
You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)
The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.

Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?
</blockquote>
</aside>
We have made <strong>several hours of videos</strong> on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.

I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.
</blockquote>
</aside>
Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)

Yes these were explained if you

And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?
</blockquote>
</aside>
I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.

<blockquote>
It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.
</blockquote>
</aside>
Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:<br>
Create a server api that receives a request.<br>
The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.<br>
The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.
Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.

<blockquote>
Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?
</blockquote>
</aside>
Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.
If you want solutions, there are several options:
<ol>
<li>Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)</li>
<li>Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)</li>
<li>Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)</li>
<li>Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q &amp; A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.
</blockquote>
</aside>
This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.
The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.

<blockquote>
Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.
</blockquote>
</aside>
If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.
But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.
What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.
I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.

<blockquote>
They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.
</blockquote>
</aside>
Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. <strong>Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.</strong>  Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.
Now is a good time to start.

<blockquote>
Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. "
</blockquote>
</aside>
That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.

I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?
</blockquote>
</aside>
They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.
<strong>Luckily for you,</strong> our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).

The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.
</blockquote>
</aside>
If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.

<blockquote>
In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.
</blockquote>
</aside>
Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?
Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.
But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.
You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.

<blockquote>
It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.
Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.
</blockquote>
</aside>
I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither <code>respect</code> nor <code>kindness</code> is evident in your post.
But thank you for your feedback.
One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.
And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.
Kind regards,<br>
TDS team
