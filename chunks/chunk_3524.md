  Thanks for the response <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> ..  just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock  linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of   everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers.. Anyway thanks and appreciate all the help
