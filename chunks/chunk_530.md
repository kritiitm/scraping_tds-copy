  Hi Guddu ,
I didnâ€™t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?
command that I used :<br>
<code>uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data</code>
here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.
Kind regards<br>
Jivraj
