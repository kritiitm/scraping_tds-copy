  2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didnâ€™t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.<br>
When I logged in today it says score is 0.<br>
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?<br>
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?<br>
If [seek] (<a href="https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002" class="inline-onebox">Nptel Seekh</a>) can access [TDS exam] (<a href="https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Technical Assessment</a>) then why we need to submit from seek?
