  Dear <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> , and <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a>
Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.
<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.<br>
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.
I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.
