  Hi everyone,
A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.
Firstly students <em>vastly</em> overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.
So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.<br>
Only 2 students managed it.
Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 <em>might</em> have even managed to get 3 or more marks.
<em>So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.</em> The mean bonus score was 1.27.
So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.
That is the data for you.

Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.
None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?
Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are <em>not</em> widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!
<strong>Bonuses are not a right.</strong> They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.
However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:
<blockquote>
Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.
