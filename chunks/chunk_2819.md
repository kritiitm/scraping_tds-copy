  Project 2 marks are showing 0 for me, when I checked logs no requests were made to my endpoint. Could you please check into this, and update as soon as possible?<br>
Getting marks in this project would help me to pass this sub. Also, please check if evaluation has been done for my endpoint or not.
Thank you
