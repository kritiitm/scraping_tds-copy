  <a class="mention" href="/u/daksh76">@daksh76</a> thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.
If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?
Thats why you are getting the error.
Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.
Kind regards
