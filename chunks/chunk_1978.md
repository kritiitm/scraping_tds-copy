  It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.
ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.
Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.<br>
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.<br>
<em>The problem is the lack of time.</em>
So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.
Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.
Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.
The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.<br>
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.
Kind regards
