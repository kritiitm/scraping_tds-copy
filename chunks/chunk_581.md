  For Project-1 to complete, it requires:<br>
"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before the deadline, there will be no appeal available.<br>
â€¢ Fill the form that is on the Project Page<br>
But I did not get the form; where is it? While I checked inside the project pages also.
