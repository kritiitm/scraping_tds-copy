I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation.
The docker image which I share is working at my end.  The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasnâ€™t aware of the infra level restrictions.
I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it.
Thanks,<br>
Garima
