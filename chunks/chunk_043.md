  Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/nelson">@Nelson</a>
Your answers on the <a href="https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">exam</a> site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).
Kind regards
