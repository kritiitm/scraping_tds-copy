  I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I donâ€™t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion. I request to check my dockerfile once again and provide the marks accordingly
