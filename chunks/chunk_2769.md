  But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x<br>
Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60%<br>
We have learned so many things  and try to implement in it too,…
Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade … and our CGPA doesn’t decrease much<br>
because projects hold the major chunk in grading
