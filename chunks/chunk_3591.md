  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@Carlton</a> With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion.
I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns?
Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?
