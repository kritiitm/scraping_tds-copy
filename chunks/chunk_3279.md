  A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a>.
<a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.
Once again, thank you both!
