  Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/23f1002382">@23f1002382</a> ,<br>
Unfortunately itâ€™s not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.
All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2 <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/victory_hand.png?v=14" title=":victory_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":victory_hand:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">
