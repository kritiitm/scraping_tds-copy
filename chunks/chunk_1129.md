Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.

Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1,  link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.
