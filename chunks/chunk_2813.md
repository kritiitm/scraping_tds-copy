I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately <strong>50 to 60 seconds</strong> to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both <strong>Podman</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong> environments.
Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on <strong>Railway</strong> and submitted that link as well.
If possible, I kindly request either of the following:
<ol>
<li>Re-evaluation using the <strong>Railway link</strong> I provided, or</li>
<li>Re-evaluation using the <strong>Render link</strong>, with allowance for the 50â€“60 second activation time.</li>
</ol>
Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.
Thank you for your support and guidance.
