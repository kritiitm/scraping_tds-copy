  The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using <code>127.0.0.1</code> and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with <code>http://localhost:8000/api</code> to see if it works.
If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the <code>ipconfig</code> command to check the correct IP address.
We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.
