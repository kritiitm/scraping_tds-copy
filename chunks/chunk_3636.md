  To all the people who are posting in this thread, I kindly request you to get the correct facts and data before starting a new thread.
So here are the first steps towards making this thread a more informed one:
<ol>
<li>What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?</li>
<li>What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?</li>
<li>Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?</li>
<li>Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?</li>
<li>Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?</li>
<li>After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?</li>
</ol>
Patiently waiting for all your responses.
