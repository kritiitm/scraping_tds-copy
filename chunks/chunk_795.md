  Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> sir, I have implemented the code for B3 &amp; B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 &amp; B6 —
<ul>
<li>
<strong>B6</strong>. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website
</li>
<li>
<strong>B3</strong>. Fetch data from an API and save it
</li>
</ul>
They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?
Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?
