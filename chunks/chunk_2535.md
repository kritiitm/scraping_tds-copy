Respected Sir,
We kindly request a one-day extension for Project 2, as we finished with vivas and OPPE yesterday only. The circumstances this time have been more challenging than in Project 1, making it difficult to meet the deadline.
We would be extremely grateful if you could consider this request. Your support would be highly appreciated.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards
