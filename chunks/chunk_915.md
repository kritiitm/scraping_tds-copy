  sir,<br>
It is a humble requests from my side, to plz extend the deadline.<br>
Because student like who come from non technical background, are unable to come up with this project…<br>
though we have somehow comeup with the GAs taking the helps of groups, seniors and sessions.<br>
Moreover I am Dual Degree student. It is very hectic for me.<br>
Sir you won’t believe but I am continuously trying since last week. Specially after the release of the sessions… Whole day and night have gone like nothing, infront of the computer…<br>
Plz sir understand the situation and extend the deadline…
