  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term<br>
I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did<br>
Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.
