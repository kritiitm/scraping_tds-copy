  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> sir plss extend deadline as it is taking too much time to understand the project and this is completely new for us, we are trying our best but couldn’t able to make it. Some days extension might reduce our stress and we’ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us.
