  I think in Q.6 its some error in your codeâ€™s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.
In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)
