  Hi Shalini,
We are aware of the issue and <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.
<strong>The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.</strong>
Kind regards
