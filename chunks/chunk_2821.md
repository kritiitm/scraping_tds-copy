  Sir, I too had provided render API and my logs do not show that it was accessed during the evaluation period. I had submitted the link in the form which was provided to update the link as i had not received any mail that my project had been evaluated before that.<br>
Due to this, my score stands 0 as of now.<br>
Sir, can you please look into this. Thank you
