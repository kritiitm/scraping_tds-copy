I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.
I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.
I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.
I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.
I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.
Thank you for your time and understanding.
