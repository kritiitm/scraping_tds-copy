  Hello sir,
My question is, the questions my endpoint will be evaluated are they the exact same ones with same parameters for my respective email as on the assignment portal ?
Essentially I am trying to understand there are certain questions where I donâ€™t have to solve the question again and just return the hardcoded answers, would that be correct ?
