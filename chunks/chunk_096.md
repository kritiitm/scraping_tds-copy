  <strong>Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question</strong>
quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly.<br>
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.
thanks
