  Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/lakshaygarg654">@lakshaygarg654</a>
Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.
We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.
We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.
Kind regards
