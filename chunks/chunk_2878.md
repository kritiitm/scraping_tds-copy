  Sir, Same here, you can access it via this link <a href="https://phoenix-1743854088883.staticrun.app/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Assignment solver </a>
I kindly request you to check immediately by this link as I also have made it as an web app for your ease.
(my friends: please don’t use the link, as the api token request will be over)
Please look after it, already I was marked as absent for project -1 and now for this project -2 as 0. I don’t know why?..I don’t know whether I could be able to pass this course even with lots of efforts..
