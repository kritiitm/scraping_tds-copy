  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> Sir please shift the ROE date to another date because we really need time to understand all these stuffs as these are so hard for beginners like us and there is quiz 2 and we have to prepare for that also.<br>
Sir please understand our situation and pay attention to our concern.
