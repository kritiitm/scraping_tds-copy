  Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>.<br>
I answered questions on <a href="https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/</a> but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.<br>
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)
