Dear Sir,<br>
In my course dashboard, it shows project 2 status as absent, but i have already submitted the repo and api points well before deadline in the given forum. Still my vercel server is running and api is resolving as expected. Please look into this matter, because I already had issue in my project 1 and lost marks in that. Expecting a positive response from your end.
