I will have to get authorisation from the operations to allow embedding you tube videos. This was a deliberate choice as the content is strictly speaking owned by IITM. Embeddings may allow others to monetise content without the appropriate permissions.
I will enquire on your behalf. I accept that not every channel follows the directives properly, so you might find it possible to embed other channel videos from IITM, but I can only go by the agreed upon protocols.
I know thatâ€™s not much comfort, but if its possible, I will amend the permissions.
Kind regards
