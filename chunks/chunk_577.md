  Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.
