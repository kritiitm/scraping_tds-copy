  Hello  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> Could you please share an update on the expected results for P2? Also, could you confirm whether my evaluation has been completed?<br>
Additionally, when would it be safe to stop the VM, as it is consuming a significant amount of credits?<br>
Looking forward to your response.<br>
Thanks and Regards.
