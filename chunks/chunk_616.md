  Hi Aindree,
No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was <em>updated</em> on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.
Thanks for bringing it to our attention.
Kind regards
