  Do all of us have to give the latest project link or only those whose links have actually changed. <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a>.
Basically should we resubmit the link using the form sent today if our link has not changed?
PS: Maybe send a mail to everyone to update the access of their GA7 links to viewer for everyone at IIT Madras.
