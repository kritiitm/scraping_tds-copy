I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.
But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.
Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.<br>
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.
These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.
Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.
We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.
I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.
Kindest regards
