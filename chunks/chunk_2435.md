  Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/21f3001993">@21f3001993</a><br>
You can use the <code>zipfile</code> library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don’t even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday’s [27-03-2025] Live Session. Kindly attend the session if you want a deeper understanding of it.
