  Thanks for the answer <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a><br>
Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ?<br>
P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.
