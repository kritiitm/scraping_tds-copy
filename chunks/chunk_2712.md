  <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> I see a lot of 308â€™s as status codes in the logs I can see on render. Could you let me know if testing of my project was successful? Or if I did something wrong? My roll number is 21f2001573.
(A hint on my score would be welcome. ^_^)
