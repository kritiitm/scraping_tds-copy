I can’t personally think of any way one can do this, but it’s completely upto to the operations team.
I ask for this permission as youtube can be quite distracting and getting rid of advertisements either require an adblocker that cause some trouble once in 2 weeks, even though they don’t turn of recommendations and hence the procrastination. Embedding is another way which can stop the recommendations and the advertisements.
Hope to hear soon,<br>
