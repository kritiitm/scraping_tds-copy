  We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesnâ€™t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.
Line number 81 of your app.py
<code>subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)</code>
which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.
