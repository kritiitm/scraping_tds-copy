  Good morning sir,<br>
Could you please extend the deadline for Project 2 as today(31/03/2025) is the last day of submission and it clashes with “Eid al-Fitr”. I have small portion of work left but it won’t be possible as there is frequent visit of guests and friends. Could you please extend the deadline till 02/04/2025, this will give us enough amount of time to complete the project after our festival.<br>
Thank you
