From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.
</blockquote>
</aside>
This is correct.

Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.
</blockquote>
</aside>
This is also correct.

<blockquote>
Unfortunately, I canâ€™t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7
</blockquote>
</aside>
The mail you have pasted has definitely come from one of your peer in the course. You can try clicking the form,  evaluation criteria for reviews have been provided in the form itself. If in further doubt, try doing one review with the peer who shared the email. Now try answering Q5.
And in case you have more doubts, you can refer to the live session that happened today. I believe most of it was spent on clarifying what the bonus is for.

Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria.
</blockquote>
</aside>
Completely understand. And we too are trying to help you understand the criteria through these discussions. And believe me, we are also learning in the process.
