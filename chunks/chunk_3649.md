  Thank you for sharing the data <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> Sir
The data clearly supports my assumption that the majority of students attempted GA7 primarily to secure 100% in GAA, or  to boost their GAA scores, with learning being a secondary priority.<br>
Anyway, it is what it is.<br>
Thankyou Sir
