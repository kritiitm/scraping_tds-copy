  The task B6 was<br>
<a href="https://quotes.toscrape.com/">https://quotes.toscrape.com/</a> has quotes from famous people.<br>
The .author class has the quote authorâ€™s name.<br>
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.<br>
E.g. <code>["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]</code>
The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.
Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.
These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.
Kind regards
