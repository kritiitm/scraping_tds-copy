I submitted my exam with perfect 10 score I even went to the technical meet you guys kept and I asked that my score it showing 5/10 but I used the hacking procedure can you please tell what is my score and he said that we will take your highest score only and don’t worry it’s not 5, then I got a invite for the meet you guys kept for those who scored perfectly in the roe, after all this I don’t understand how is my score 60 percent.
