  Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/bharathi">@Bharathi</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a><br>
Could you please look into the above issue?
Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:
<h3><a name="p-599787-grading-concerns-1" class="anchor" href="#p-599787-grading-concerns-1"></a><strong>Grading Concerns</strong></h3>
<strong>Final Course Score:</strong><br>
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F<br>
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)
From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:<br>
<a href="https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838">What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?</a>.<br>
Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.
Furthermore, for Project 1 (<strong>deadline: 16th Feb 2025</strong>), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.
<h3><a name="p-599787-course-structuring-scheduling-issues-2" class="anchor" href="#p-599787-course-structuring-scheduling-issues-2"></a><strong>Course Structuring &amp; Scheduling Issues</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Many students pursuing this course are <strong>dual-degree students or working professionals</strong>, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.</li>
<li>The <strong>last-minute guidance</strong> for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.</li>
<li>The <strong>structuring and scheduling of sessions</strong> feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="p-599787-request-for-improvement-3" class="anchor" href="#p-599787-request-for-improvement-3"></a><strong>Request for Improvement</strong></h3>
To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:
<ol>
<li><strong>Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2</strong>, well in advance of the deadline.</li>
<li><strong>More structured and accessible support</strong>, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.</li>
<li><strong>Better management of exam difficulty levels</strong>, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.</li>
</ol>
I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.
