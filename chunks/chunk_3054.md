I would like to share that we have successfully completed <strong>TDS Project 2</strong>, solving <strong>46/57</strong> cases dynamically via <strong>Azure after deployment</strong>! We also tested it with our friends’ <strong>GA questions</strong>, and it’s working as expected.
This project was a <strong>team effort</strong> by me and two friends [ <a class="mention" href="/u/lakshaygarg654">@lakshaygarg654</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2004637">@23f2004637</a> ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.
I would love the opportunity to <strong>demonstrate our project</strong> to <strong>TA and Anand Sir</strong> in a <strong>Google Meet session</strong> on <strong>March 31st</strong> (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).
If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.
