  is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I had exams and would like do week 4,week 5 before week 6 and doing the assignment is a huge part in learning, any on the just doing the assignments or answers for the assignments? I understand that each set of students get different questions. <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a>
